# GameJamItch
My first ever game jam! It is Game Off 2021 and I am going to use pygame to create one, hopefully I can finish it in time. The theme is: BUG

Ideas:
- Putting a bug on a car then following it, with a game like that
- Smashing bugs and killing them
- You have to find the bug in a code
- You are a bug trying to avoid getting hit by a swatter
- Clicker Game about ants
- Ants want to eat you, dodge them!
